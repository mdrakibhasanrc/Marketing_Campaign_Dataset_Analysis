# Business Problem:
A digital advertising company is running multiple advertising campaigns across different platforms for various advertisers. They are collecting a vast amount of data related to each campaign's performance, audience reach, ad creatives, and costs. The company wants to leverage this data to optimize their advertising strategies, improve ROI, and better understand their audience's behavior. However, they are facing challenges in making sense of the data due to its complexity and volume.

Key points to address:

### Campaign Performance Analysis:

Identify the best-performing campaigns based on metrics like clicks, impressions, and media cost.
Analyze the correlation between campaign duration (no_of_days) and performance indicators to determine the optimal campaign length.

### Platform and Channel Effectiveness:
Evaluate the performance of different advertising platforms (ext_service_name) and channels (channel_name).
Determine which platforms and channels are driving the highest impressions, clicks, and unique reach.

### Creative Analysis:
Study the impact of different creative images (creative_id) and templates (template_id) on click-through rates (CTR) and conversions.
Identify the most effective ad creatives in terms of engagement and conversion rates.

### Audience Targeting:
Explore the use of search tags (search_tags) and keywords (keywords) to understand the audience's interests and behavior.
Optimize ad targeting by identifying the most relevant search tags and keywords for each campaign.

### Cost and Budget Management:
Monitor the campaign budgets (campaign_budget_usd) and ensure that they are aligned with the overall media costs (media_cost_usd).
Analyze the media cost trends over time and take measures to control the cost while maintaining performance.

### Geographic and Demographic Insights:
Utilize advertiser locations (advertiser_name) to understand regional performance variations.
Segment the audience based on geographic and demographic factors to target specific user groups effectively.

### Timezone and Weekday Analysis:
Analyze campaign performance in different time zones (time_zone) to optimize ad scheduling.
Compare performance on weekdays and weekends (weekday_cat) to identify variations in user behavior.
